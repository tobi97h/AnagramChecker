# Anagram Checker

Run `gradle installDist` from the root project (this requires gradle and jdk 8 or higher).

After that you find an `app.bat` / `app` file inside `app/build/install/app/bin`, which then can be invoked with two input parameters to check for anagrams.

Like so:

```sh
./app race care
```

Alternatively you can find a precomipled version in the releases section. Simply download, extract and run it from the `bin` folder.
